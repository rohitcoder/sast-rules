  message: It looks like MD5 is used as a password hash. MD5 is not considered a secure
    password hash because it can be cracked by an attacker in a short amount of time.
    Use a suitable password hashing function such as bcrypt. You can use `password_hash($PASSWORD,
    PASSWORD_BCRYPT, $OPTIONS);`.
