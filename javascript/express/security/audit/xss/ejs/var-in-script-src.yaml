  message: Detected a template variable used as the 'src' in a script tag. Although
    template variables are HTML escaped, HTML escaping does not always prevent malicious
    URLs from being injected and could results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    Prefer not to dynamically generate the 'src' attribute and use static URLs instead.
    If you must do this, carefully check URLs against an allowlist and be sure to
    URL-encode the result.
